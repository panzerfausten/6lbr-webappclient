6lbr-webappclient
===========

This is an example webapp that takes exposed data and displays it a nice firefox OS-like style

To make things work you need to specify the router URL in the js/nodeList.js file
If you want to make it work using the php middleware you need to mount the app and the php file in the
same HTTP server with a php5 plugin activated.

Also, you need the modified version of 6lbr provided at:
